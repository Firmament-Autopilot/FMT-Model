# Boat Plant Model

This model is contributed by shaolong Yang, xingyun Gao, yanhao Sun, yanji Zhu, and xianbo Xiang from the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering of Huazhong University of Science and Technology with support of FMT teams. The model can be referenced from Rapid Development Method of Autopilot Controller for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Based on ROS Hardware in Loop Simulation(DOI:10.27157/d.cnki.ghzku.2021.005521) as well as Design and Verification of Unmanned Surface Vehicle's Autopilot Based on Integral Line of Sight Guidance(2024 14th Asian Control Conference (ASCC), Dalian, China, 2024, pp. 374-380). 
  
It is an underactuated unmanned surface vessel(USV) model featuring a single thruster and a rudder, supporting forward and backward motion.
